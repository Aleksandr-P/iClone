# Layer Manager

### Version: 0.8.2 (in progress)

### Introduction

Layer Manager is a utility that creates layer controls for iClone. When Using Layer Manager - every object that is created within iClone is placed on a Layer - 
each object defaults to the World Layer. Each layer has it's own properties - and each object assumes the properties of the layer it exists on. Layers can easily be hidden or other operations.
